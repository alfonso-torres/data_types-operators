# Introduction to Python data type and operators

- Strings
- Numbers Integers -> floats, longs
- Boolean (True or False)

### Arithmetic Operators
### Comparision Operators

- Arithmetic Operators

```` python
+, -, *, /
````
- Modulos
``` % ``` It gives the remainder of the 2 numbers
  
- Comparison Operators
- ``>`` greater than
- ```<```less than
- `>=` greater than equal to
- `==`
- `!=` not equal to

## Strings and Casting


- Indexing in Python starts from 0
- ` H e l l o` ` `   `  ` `w o r l d  !`
-  `0 1 2 3 4` `5` `6 7 8 9 10 11`
- Reverse Indexing
- ` H e l l o   w o r l d  !`
-  `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 -1`

### Let's have a look at some strings methods

### Concatenation and Casting

- We use the symbol `+` to concatenate: <br/>
` First_name = "James"
  ` <br/>
  ` Last_name = "Bond"
  `<br/>
  ` print(First_name + " " + Last_name)
  `
  
- To convert one data type to another data type we have the concept of Casting:
